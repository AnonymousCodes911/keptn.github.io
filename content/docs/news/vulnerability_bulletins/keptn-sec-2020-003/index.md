## Recommendations

The release of **jmeter-service** in version **0.11.4** contains the new JMeter version v5.4.2. 

We recommend upgrading your Keptn control plane to 0.11.x as soon as possible allowing you to upgrade the **jmeter-service** to version **0.11.4**.

Please follow this [upgrade path](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.11.x/operate/upgrade/#upgrade-from-keptn-0-11-x-to-keptn-0-11-4).
