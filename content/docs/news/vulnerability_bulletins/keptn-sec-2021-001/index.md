## Affected

Keptn jmeter-service in version 0.11.3 and older.

## Description

Keptn jmeter-service in version 0.11.3 and older includes JMeter with a version below v5.4.2 that is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution due to the embedded Log4j version. We believe that this issue can be exploited in some conditions.

With JMeter v5.4.2 the bug is fixed ([changelog](https://jmeter.apache.org/changes.html)).

## Severity

*of Log4j:*

  * **CVE-2021-44228** [details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)

  * **CVE-2021-45046** [details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)

## Recommendations

The release of **jmeter-service** in version **0.11.4** contains the new JMeter version v5.4.2. We recommend upgrading your Keptn control plane to 0.11.x as soon as possible allowing you to upgrade the **jmeter-service** to version **0.11.4**.

Please follow this [upgrade path](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.11.x/operate/upgrade/#upgrade-from-keptn-0-11-x-to-keptn-0-11-4).

## Workaround
